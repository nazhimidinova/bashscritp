## Pseudo code for auto git push

### First identify if you are in a repository

# if current directory has ".git" folder; then 
#get the status of git 
#track the files that are updated/created
#commit your tracked files with a message
#push them to github (SCM) 
#else 
#ask for the repo name & search the system for the directory 
#if result is found; then
#go inside the directory
#else 
#notify the user the repo doesnt exist
